\section{Exercise 4: Machine Learning}
The last exercise is about machine learning. Therefore we will use \textit{Python} and \textit{Tensorflow} 
to analyze and work on Smarthome data captured in a \textit{.csv} file. 
As this is done in an \textit{Jupyter Notebook} the task could be done local or in \textit{Google Colab}.

\subsection{Setup}
As i prefer to work on my local machine and the \textit{Jupyter Notebook} file which was handed out 
worked with \textit{Google Colab} i had to do some changes to the code.
These sections are marked with \textit{Requirements WSL} in the \textit{Jupyter Notebook} file 
which can be found in the \textit{exercise\_sheet 4} folder.

\subsection{Documentation}
As the exercises were done in the \textit{Jupyter Notebook} file, the documentation of the two exercises 
is also done there as markdown text and code comments.
Please see the \textit{Jupyter Notebook} file in the \textit{exercise\_sheet 4} folder for the documentation.
